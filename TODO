I need to create a way of rotating joints on the z axis such that identical joints end up facing the same direction for deduplication purposes.
I suspect that choosing the vertex most opposite to average when viewed from above would work.

I need to refactor the sorting at the end to allow for this final transformation.

I'd also like to clean the code for readability, if possible.
